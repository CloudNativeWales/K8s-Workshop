# Service

The smallest deployable entity in Kubernetes is a pod. Container(s) run in a pod.

In this exercise we will see how to spin up multiple containers. We will also see how the Kubernetes controller react when we kill on of the pods when.

## Start some containers

Let's start a bunch of pods that uses an pre-composed docker image of elasticsearch

```bash
kubectl run elastic --image=elasticsearch:2 --replicas=7
```

Watch the magic
```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```
You should see pods in 'Initialising' state and then will transition to 'Running' 

## Delete that pod
Grab one of the pod names and delete the pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod <PodName>

kubectl get pods -w
```

You should see that one of the old pods is deleted and Kubernetes has spun up a new pod

# Kubernetes service

A service in k8s land is a stable address for a pod or a cluster of pods. Service is created using:
```bash
kubectl expose
```
This allows us to connect to our pods. Let's expose elasticsearch HTTP api port:

```bash
kubectl expose deploy/elastic --port 9200 --type=LoadBalancer
```

This command will show you the internal IP address that was allocated to it
```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Get ip address from above and you can curl
```bash
curl http://<ipaddress>:9200/
```

You can find more detail about the service using:
```bash
kubectl describe service elastic
```
It includes information about the service e.g. the 7 endpoints for the 7 pods that we've spun up.

You can also scale up/down the replicas using the following commands.

To get the deployment name:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

Get the deployment name and scale down the number of pods running

```bash
kubectl scale deploy/<DeploymentName> --replicas=2
```
